# Qt-VTK-viewer

A CMake/C++ project for embedding a VTK 3D view in a Qt window. This application provides a powerful interface for visualizing and interacting with 2D and 3D models and scientific data using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) within a Qt-based graphical user interface.

## Project Overview

The Qt-VTK-viewer is designed to:
- Load and visualize 3D models and scientific data
- Provide interactive 3D navigation and manipulation
- Support various visualization techniques through VTK
- Offer a user-friendly interface built with Qt

## Prerequisites

- **Qt 6.x** - The application framework
- **VTK 9.x** - Visualization Toolkit (must be compiled from source)
  - See [Build-VTK.md](doc/Build-VTK.md) for compilation instructions
- **OOpenCAL** - Required for certain model types
  - The project uses headers from the OOpenCAL library
  - Set the `OOPENCAL_DIR` CMake variable to point to your OOpenCAL base directory

### OOpenCAL Setup

In CMake, set the `OOPENCAL_DIR` variable to the base directory of your OOpenCAL installation. For example, if your OOpenCAL files are located at:
```
~/BestSoftwareEver/OOpenCAL/models/Ball/BallCell.h
```
Then set:
```
OOPENCAL_DIR=~/BestSoftwareEver
```

## Documentation

### API Documentation

Comprehensive API documentation is available and can be generated using Doxygen:

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

The generated documentation will be available in the `doc/html` directory.

## Project Structure

Key components of the project include:

- **ModelReader**: Handles reading and parsing model data from files
- **MainWindow**: The main application window and UI implementation
- **Config**: Manages application configuration and settings
- **Visualization**: Contains VTK-based visualization components

## How the Visualizer Works

- **Configuration files**: Each run starts from a configuration file (typically opened via `File → Open Configuration`) that defines grid dimensions, number of simulation steps, and node tiling. The `GENERAL` section provides values such as `number_of_columns`, `number_of_rows`, and `output_file_name`, while the `DISTRIBUTED` section describes how many nodes (`number_node_x`, `number_node_y`) partition the domain.
- **Generated output files**: The `output_file_name` parameter is the basename for data generated by OOpenCAL simulations. For a name like `output_file_name=sciddicaTout`, the viewer expects per-node data inside `models/<ModelName>/Output/` as pairs of files: `sciddicaTout{NODE}_index.txt` with `<step> <offset>` mappings and `sciddicaTout{NODE}.txt` storing the serialized cell values for every step.
- **Step playback and navigation**: When a configuration is loaded, the application rebuilds the global grid by reading each node file for the chosen step, stitching them into a complete scene, and rendering both the combined view and per-node boundaries. You can scrub steps with the playback controls, keyboard arrows, or the step spin box; the viewer keeps UI elements in sync and reports mismatches between declared and available steps.
- **Model-specific loaders**: Each model defines its own `Element` type and parsing rules. The plugin and built-in models register readers through `SceneWidgetVisualizerFactory`, so the same viewer can inspect multiple simulation formats. Load additional models dynamically through `Model → Load Plugin…`, place plugins in `./plugins/`, or supply them via the `--loadModel` command-line argument. 
- **Rendering pipeline**: `SceneWidget` hosts the VTK scene, managing 2D/3D camera modes, dynamic color maps, and auxiliary overlays (grid lines, orientation axes, rulers). Data changes trigger incremental renders to keep interaction responsive while navigating large datasets.

## Building the Project

1. Create a build directory and configure the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. -DOOPENCAL_DIR=/path/to/your/OOpenCAL
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./QtVtkViewer
   ```
   
## Command-Line Arguments

The application supports various command-line arguments for automated testing, batch processing, and customized startup behavior.

### Quick Examples

```bash
# Load configuration with specific model
./QtVtkViewer config.txt --startingModel=Ball

# Generate video automatically
./QtVtkViewer config.txt --generateMoviePath=/tmp/movie.ogv --exitAfterLastStep

# Generate image at specific step
./QtVtkViewer config.txt --step=100 --generateImagePath=/tmp/step100.png

# Batch processing with silent mode
./QtVtkViewer config.txt --generateMoviePath=/tmp/movie.ogv --exitAfterLastStep --silent
```

For complete documentation of all available arguments, see **[doc/COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS.md](doc/COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS.md)**.

## Features

### 🔌 Plugin System for Custom Models (NEW!)

The application now supports **loading custom models as plugins** without recompiling the application!

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Add custom models as shared libraries (.so files)
- ✅ No recompilation of the main application needed
- ✅ **Load plugins via GUI** - Model → Load Plugin... (Ctrl+P)
- ✅ Auto-load from `./plugins/` directory at startup
- ✅ Full example plugin included in `examples/custom_model_plugin/`

**Quick Start (GUI Method):**
1. Launch QtVtkViewer
2. Go to **Model → Load Plugin...** (or press Ctrl+P)
3. Select your `.so` file
4. Your model appears in the Model menu immediately!

**Quick Start (Auto-load Method):**
```bash
# Create your custom cell model inheriting from Element
# Compile it as a plugin (.so)
# Place in ./plugins/ directory
# Launch QtVtkViewer - your model appears automatically!
```

See **[doc/PLUGIN_USER_GUIDE.md](doc/PLUGIN_USER_GUIDE.md)** for complete guide and examples.

### ✨ Runtime Model Switching & Configuration Loading

The application supports **dynamic model switching and configuration loading at runtime**:

**Model Switching:**
- Switch between different cell models via the **Model menu**
- Built-in models: Ball, SciddicaT
- Add your own via plugins (no recompilation!)
- Easy to extend with new models

**Configuration Loading:**
- Load new configuration files via **File → Open Configuration** (Ctrl+O)
- Automatically clears scene and reloads with new parameters
- Updates GUI (steps, dimensions) automatically

### 🎥 2D and 3D View Modes

The application supports switching between **2D** and **3D** visualization modes!

**2D Mode (Default):**
- Top-down orthographic view optimized for 2D cellular automata
- Rotation disabled to prevent accidental camera movement
- Zoom and pan enabled
- **2D Ruler axes** with scale, tick marks, and grid lines around the scene

**3D Mode:**
- Full 3D perspective view with interactive camera controls
- Mouse-based rotation, pan, and zoom
- Precise camera control via sliders:
  - **Azimuth** slider: Horizontal rotation (-180° to +180°)
  - **Elevation** slider: Vertical tilt (-90° to +90°)
- **Orientation axes widget** in bottom-left corner (X=red, Y=green, Z=blue)
- Perfect for examining data from different angles

**How to Use:**
- Switch modes via **View → 2D Mode** or **View → 3D Mode**
- In 3D mode, camera control sliders appear above playback controls
- See [VIEW_MODES.md](doc/VIEW_MODES.md) for detailed documentation

**Quick Start:**
1. Run the application
2. **Model** → Select model (Ball or SciddicaT)
3. **File → Open Configuration** → Select config file
4. **View** → Choose 2D or 3D mode
5. Done! Visualization loaded
